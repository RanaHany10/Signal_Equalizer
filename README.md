# Signal Equalizer

Signal Equalizer is a powerful desktop application designed to manipulate and equalize signal frequencies across various modes, from uniform ranges to musical instruments and ECG abnormalities. With intuitive slider controls and real-time visualization, this tool offers precise adjustments for signal enhancement and analysis.

## Features

- **Multiple Modes:** Choose from different modes, including Uniform Range Mode, Musical Instruments Mode, Animal Sounds Mode, and ECG Abnormalities Mode, each with specific frequency control options.
  
- **Slider Controls:** Easily adjust frequency components using slider controls, with the ability to customize smoothing windows for precise equalization.
  
- **Signal Visualization:** Visualize both input and output signals with linked cine signal viewers and spectrograms, ensuring real-time feedback on equalization adjustments.
  
- **Customizable Spectrograms:** Toggle show/hide option for spectrograms, allowing for a focused view on signal analysis.
  
## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the application.
4. Choose the desired mode and adjust frequency components using the slider controls.
5. Visualize the input and output signals with linked cine signal viewers and spectrograms.
